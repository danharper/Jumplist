{"name":"Jumplist","body":"# Jumplist - Bookmarks For Bash\r\n*Beta. Haven't tested on other systems yet, but should work fine :)*\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nAdd the current directory to your Jumplist by giving it a key: `jump add newproject`\r\n\r\nYou can now jump to it at any time: `jump to newproject`\r\n\r\nDelete a location from your Jumplist with: `jump delete newproject`\r\n\r\nOr view all locations in your Jumplist with: `jump list`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nCopy `jumplist-driver` into your home directory as `.jumplist-driver`:\r\n\r\n\tcp ./jumplist-driver ~/.jumplist-driver\r\n\r\nCopy `jumplist-worker` to somewhere in your PATH (eg. `/usr/local/bin/`):\r\n\r\n\tcp ./jumplist-worker /usr/local/bin/jumplist-worker\r\n\r\nAnd give it execute permissions:\r\n\r\n\tchmod +x /usr/local/bin/jumplist-worker\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your `~/.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n\tsource ~/.jumplist-driver\r\n\r\nAnd create a settings file for Jumplist to use:\r\n\r\n\ttouch ~/.jumplistrc\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advanced Usage\r\nA shorter syntax for jumping to a directory is:\r\n\r\n\tjump newproject\r\n\r\nIs typing `jump` too long? Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n\talias j=\"jump\"\r\n\r\nYou can now:\r\n\r\n\tj newproject\r\n\tj add secondproject\r\n\tj list\r\n\r\nA full collection of aliases could be:\r\n\r\n\talias j=\"jump\"\r\n\talias jl=\"jump list\"\r\n\talias ja=\"jump add\"\r\n\talias jd=\"jump del\"\r\n\r\nUbÃ«r fast jumping:\r\n\r\n\tja proj  # Add current directory as 'proj'\r\n\tj proj   # At any other time, jump to the directory tagged 'proj'\r\n\tjl       # View all directories in your jumplist\r\n\tjd proj  # Delete the directory tagged 'proj' from your jumplist\r\n","tagline":"A bookmarking script for the Bash Shell.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
